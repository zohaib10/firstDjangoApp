1) Implementation of Redux

2) npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-devtools-extension

3) add a store.js file in src

4) setup rootReducer -: create folder called reducers and add an index.js file in it

5) finish redux setup in App.js file using Provider and store

6) create leads.js in the reducer folder - and the actions type of GET_LEADS

7) create a leads.js file in actions folder to take care of all actions regarding leads
  i.  will make all of HTTP requests here using axios (can also use fetch)
  ii. install axios 'npm i axios'

8) setup the leads component so it dispatches the action GET_LEADS to get leads from database
  i. Once we have the info we map through it as map each lead in a bootstrap table format

9) Now we can setup the DELETE_LEADS action in our leads file in the actions folder
  i.  https://alligator.io/react/axios-react/
  ii. Working in the leads- actions and reducers dir as well as the Leads component
