Error Handling & Alerts

1) When we make a bad request we get an error back which we will store in our state and use a library called react-alert to display those errors in our components.

2) Install: npm i react-alert react-alert-template-basic react-transition-group
  i.  setup react-alert within App.js
  ii. complete AlertTemplate and AlertProvider setup in App.js

3) After App.js create a file called Alerts.js in components/layout
  i. After setup import to App.js and wire it

4) Here we setup the GET_ERRORS reducer by creating a errors.js file and the handle the .catch(err) by dispatching the action

5) Now we wire up everything that needs be done in Alerts.js

6) We create an action and reducer called messages which saves a message when a new lead is added or deleted. We call it in Alerts.js and show appropriate notifications
