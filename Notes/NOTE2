1) In a new tab go to the parent directory "pipenv shell"

2) Go to the backend django project and run this "python manage.py startapp frontend"

3) Make a src folder within fronend and a components within components folder
  i. then create these :- mkdir -p ./frontend/{static,templates}/frontend

4) the components folder will house all of our components
  i.  the templates folder will house the index.html single page file to render our components to
  ii. the static folder will keep all the complied JS - webpack will do that for us

5) go to the root folder and type "npm init -y"

6) npm i -D webpack webpack-cli

7) install babel
  i. npm i -D @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-plugin-transform-class-properties

8) add the .babelec file with the presets and plugins properties

9) create the webpack.config.js file

10) go to package.json file and change scripts field

11) Set up the index.js and App.js files

12) Inside of templates/frontend we create our index.html file
  i. set up the file with bootstrap etc

13) add the frontend app to the settings.py file

14) in the views file in frontend we render the main index.html file

15) now we have to give it a url?
  i.   we set up the urls.py file in frontend
  ii.  now we add this url file ref to our main urls file
  iii. frontend needs to lead before the leads
